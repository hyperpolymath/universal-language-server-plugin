## Palimpsest License v0.8

### Preamble

The Palimpsest License acknowledges the emotional and cognitive labor involved
in software development and promotes sustainable, humane contribution practices.
It extends the MIT License with provisions for contributor well-being and
community emotional safety.

### Terms

1. **Emotional Labor Recognition**

   This project recognizes that software development involves significant
   emotional and cognitive labor beyond code production, including:
   - Mental load of context switching
   - Emotional toll of code review
   - Stress of maintaining backwards compatibility
   - Anxiety of breaking changes
   - Burden of documentation
   - Cost of community support

2. **Contributor Well-Being**

   Users and contributors of this software acknowledge:
   - Contributors are humans with finite emotional capacity
   - Response time expectations should be reasonable
   - "No" is a complete answer to feature requests
   - Maintainers may take breaks without justification
   - Burnout prevention is everyone's responsibility

3. **Reversibility Principle**

   To reduce anxiety and encourage experimentation:
   - All changes should be reversible where practical
   - Branches are encouraged for experimentation
   - Reverts are acceptable and not shameful
   - Mistakes are learning opportunities
   - "Undo" is a valid workflow

4. **Caring Community**

   This license promotes:
   - Assuming good intentions
   - Constructive feedback over criticism
   - Celebrating small contributions
   - Welcoming newcomers
   - Supporting diverse perspectives
   - Preventing harassment and toxicity

5. **Consent**

   Contributors have the right to:
   - Decline features or changes
   - Set boundaries on contribution scope
   - Step away from projects
   - Revoke consent for feature development
   - Say "not right now" without explanation

6. **Compensation Acknowledgment**

   While not requiring payment, this license acknowledges:
   - Open source is not free labor
   - Emotional labor has value
   - Financial support is appreciated
   - Corporate users should consider funding
   - Sponsorship sustains projects

7. **Publicity & Attribution**

   Users of this software should:
   - Attribute original authors
   - Acknowledge contributors
   - Credit emotional labor
   - Share improvements upstream (encouraged, not required)
   - Respect privacy of contributors

### Compatibility

The Palimpsest License is designed to be compatible with the MIT License.
All MIT License terms remain in full effect. The Palimpsest provisions are
additive and intended to guide community norms rather than impose legal
obligations beyond those in the MIT License.

### Enforcement

The Palimpsest License provisions are primarily aspirational and guide
community standards. Enforcement focuses on:
- Code of Conduct violations (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Community moderation
- Social norms rather than legal action
- Restorative justice over punitive measures

### Inspiration

This license is inspired by:
- The CCCP Manifesto (Caring, Consent, Compensation, Publicity)
- Ethical Source Movement
- Post Meritocracy Manifesto
- Contributor Covenant
- Various community care frameworks
